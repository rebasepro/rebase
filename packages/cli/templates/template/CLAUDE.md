# Rebase AI Rules
Please refer to and follow the instructions defined in [ai-instructions.md](./ai-instructions.md).
The Rebase skills for this assistant live in `.claude/skills/`. If they are not there yet, install them, with the Rebase MCP server: `rebase skills install --agent claude --mcp`.

## Before you write any code

These hold before you have opened ai-instructions.md, and in every session:

- **A table is a file in `backend/schema/`.** Declare it with `defineTable` from `@rebasepro/server/schema` — columns, relations and a required `rls` — export it from `backend/schema/index.ts`, and `pnpm dev` creates it. How it looks in the admin panel is a separate, optional file: `frontend/src/cms/<table>.tsx` with `customizeTable`, which imports the table as a type only. Never `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE` or `CREATE INDEX` in code, and never SQL as the database owner against an application table: `rebase.sql()` skips row-level security, validation and hooks, so keep it for server work that needs every row and for reading a column marked `.private()`. When the SDK cannot express a query, run it as the caller with `getSql(c)` — the same row-level security as the SDK, read-only unless `{ write: true }`, every value in `params`. A table that already exists gets its file from `pnpm schema:introspect`.
- **Data goes through the SDK:** `rebase.dataAsAdmin.<table>` in functions and crons, `getDriver(c)` to act as the caller.
- **A route in `backend/functions/` is public until you guard it** with `requireAuth` or `requireAdmin` from `@rebasepro/server/functions`.
- **Never deploy, never edit `.env`, never edit generated files** (`backend/src/schema.generated.ts`, `rebase.resources.json`).
- **When Rebase cannot do what the task needs, tell the human** what is missing instead of working around it.
