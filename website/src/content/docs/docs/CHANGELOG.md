# Changelog

## [0.1.2] - 2026-05-15

### Improvements

- **Removed `lodash` dependency** — Replaced `lodash/cloneDeep` with a custom `deepClone` utility in `@rebasepro/utils`. This eliminates the external dependency and fixes `npx create-rebase-app` failing due to missing `lodash` at runtime.
- **New `deepClone` utility** — A lightweight deep-clone function that preserves function references and class instances (Date, GeoPoint, etc.), designed specifically for Rebase collection objects.

### CI & Tooling

- **Automated release pipeline** — New GitHub Actions workflow (`Publish Stable Release`) that handles version bumping, npm publishing, and GitHub Release creation in a single click from the Actions tab.
- **Local release script** — `pnpm release:patch`, `pnpm release:minor`, `pnpm release:major` for releasing from the command line with the same pipeline.
- **Canary releases** — Every push to `main` publishes a canary version to npm (`@canary` dist-tag).

### Fixes

- Fixed navigation utility tests to assert the correct call signature with `undefined` options parameter.
- Updated package descriptions to reflect the Postgres-based architecture.
